		<dl class=issue>
			<dt>Number:

				<a href="https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/628">Issue 628</a>

			<dt>Title:
			<dd>
				Limit the scope of FO Council deliberations

			<dt>From:
			<dd>
				Pierre-Anthony Lemieux

			<dt>Summary:
			<dd>
				The FO Council should sustain an FO only if rejecting the FO would necessarily result in a violation of the W3C process.
				As it stands, there are no limitations to what folks can file as FO and what the Council will consider.

			<dt>Resolution to close:
			<dd>
				<a href="https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/628#issuecomment-1308964438">RESOLVED: Close 628 no change, flag Commenter Not Satisfied</a>

			<dt>Summary of rationale to close:
			<dd>
				W3C normally makes decisions by consensus.
				Formal objections happen when we fail to reach consensus
				(regardless of why)
				but try to move forward anyway.
				The Council is there to determine the best way forward
				in the face of irreconcilable differences of opinion,
				not to adjudicate right vs wrong in terms of rules being followed.
				Simple process violations typically result in the team handling them, not FOs.
				Focusing the Council solely on process violations would make the Council mostly useless.

			<dt>AB Confirmation:
			<dd>
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/03/16-ab-minutes.html#r03">RESOLUTION</a>: “The AB accepts the resolution of issue #628 knowing it was closed over objection.”

			<dt>Title:
			<dd>
				Appeal process for proposals

			<dt>From:
			<dd>
				James Rosewell

			<dt>Summary:
			<dd>
				From <a href="https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/478#issue-769236173">the opening GitHub comment</a>:
				<blockquote>
				Group chairs [should] make the initial decision should a complaint be received
				relating to the scope of a proposal fulfilling the goals of the W3C
				as defined in the membership agreement […]
				within 7 elapsed days.
				[…]
				Should disagreement remain,
				the General Counsel of the W3C [would] be asked to intervene
				by at least one member to seek to obtain consensus within 7 elapsed days.
				Should consensus still not be possible
				a majority vote of the AC […] [should] make the final decision within 7 elapsed days.
				In the event of a tie arbitration [should] be used to resolve the matter.
				</blockquote>

			<dt>Resolution to close:
			<dd>
				<a href="https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/478#issuecomment-1198188118">RESOLVED: #478 is closed</a>

			<dt>Summary of rationale to close:
			<dd>
				<a href="https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/478#issuecomment-1453030404">Full details in GitHub comment</a>,
				with the main point being:
				<blockquote>
				“Adding” an appeal process would be redundant with existing appeal processes.
				From expressing disagreement when a proposal is initially made,
				to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#managing-dissent">registering dissent</a>,
				to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#addressing-fo">having FOs processed by the Council</a>,
				to having the ability to file an <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#ACAppeal">AC Appeal</a>,
				there's already a path to express and escalate disagreement,
				and no decision is final until these are all exhausted.
				</blockquote>

			<dt>AB Confirmation:
			<dd>
				<a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/03/16-ab-minutes.html#r04">RESOLUTION</a>: “The AB accepts the resolution of issue #478 as summarized in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/478#issuecomment-1453030404">w3c/w3process#478 (comment)”</a>.
